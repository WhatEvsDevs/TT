I organise kitchens, bathrooms, and laundry spaces.
For the spring, for the winter, if you're selling or if you're buying.
I help simplify and inspire through tidying.

# Products

I provide a service which transforms kitchens, bathrooms, and laundries into well-organised spaces that help you enjoy spending time in your home.

## Step 1: Consultation

My services begin with an in-home consultation where we make a plan catered to your needs and lifestyle. We determine which spaces need a touch of love, which spaces are most important to you, and how involved you would like to be in the transformation process.

## Step 2: Visualisation

After we have a basic plan, we move into the visualisation stage. Here we begin by using various forms of media to illustrate your ideal space. After careful consideration of your "must-haves" we will agree on a budget so that we can begin transforming your visualisation into a realisation!

## Step 3: Realisation

We conclude our transformation process by bringing your expectations to reality. Here I will purchase anything from spices and detergents to pans and appliances for your new space. All organisation and installation of any new products will be done for you so that you can dive into loving your new space!
