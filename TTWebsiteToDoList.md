Motto: 'with my strength and wisdom i create serenity'

Official Name: "Tasteful Transformations by Traci"

Description: "Through Strength and Wisdom I create Serenity.  We all have areas of the home that tend to bring us down.  Either through clutter, disorganisation or old memories that we know it's time to part with. I come in, offer some suggestions, and together we will make your areas inspiring, new, and refreshing. Or, if you are relocating, I can help transform your new house into a welcoming home.

(All you need to do is organise your dinner party...wait..I can do that too! #peaceandquiet #Simplify #organisehome #Transform #thermomix #doterra)"
